# Welcome to Yondr's GitHub Repo
Some general house keeping
 - If you are creating new repositorities please put your project name as a suffix to the repo name. example: `gismo-my-new-repo`
 - Access is limited to users with Yondr email accounts. External/Contractor Github users (inc person github accounts) must be associated with a Yondrgroup.com account.
 - Write meaningful commit messages on branchs and squash rebase into `main` describing the main deliverables for that branch being merged (inc PRs)
 - Embrace GitHub flow and Actions for CI/CD where possible

If you require any assistance please contact **Martyn Norman - Global Head of Architecture & Development** 
or raise a support ticket in [YondrHelp](https://helpdesk.yondrhelp.com/a/dashboard/default)
